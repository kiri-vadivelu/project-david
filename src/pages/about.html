    Members of Municipal Socialist Alliance (MSA) democratically endorsed Corey
    David for Toronto city council Ward 20 Scarborough southwest and registered
    the campaign at City Hall on Wednesday, September 20, 2023. See complete
    program at
    <a href="https://municipal.socialistalliance.ca/program">MSA Website</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    While the Municipal Socialist Alliance (MSA) was formed by revolutionary
    socialists, anti-poverty organizers, and disability-justice organizers as an
    electoral alliance, our primary goal remains radical transformation of
    society rather than electoral success. In running an electoral campaign, MSA
    seek to build up our community-based power in order to tear down oppressive
    systems and institutions and replace status quo corporate domination with a
    government run by and for the working class and the oppressed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Corey was the Socialist Action candidate in the January 2021 Scarborough
    Agincourt by-election, and was the MSA candidate in Ward 20 in the October
    2022 municipal election. He championed social housing, quality public
    long-term care and health care, workersâ€™ power, and de-funding the police.
  </p>
  <p>
    MSA do not sacrifice the basic principles of liberation and justice for all
    in order to win elections. Therefore MSA participate in elections to
    challenge entrenched power and to re-orient discussion towards the
    fundamental societal transformation needed for the masses to live
    comfortably and in harmony with our neighbours and nature.

  <p>
    Just as Corey, MSA seeks to dismantle the systems of capitalism,
    imperialism, colonialism, hetero-normative patriarchy, and white supremacy.
    MSA also supports Indigenous Land Back and Indigenous self-determination,
    disbanding the police and carceral institutions, free public transit,
    expansion of public services, and immediate action on climate change.
