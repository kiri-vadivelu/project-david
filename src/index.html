  <h1>Corey David for Scarborough Southwest</h1>

  <p>
    In 2020, Corey David campaigned to stop the for-profit housing development
    at the Quarry Lands, which destroyed the natural habitat and park space â€”
    another reason radical change is needed at City Hall.
  </p>
  <p>
    A proud member of the Amalgamated Transit Workers' Union (ATU Local 113) who
    supported individuals with developmental disabilities working as front-line
    staff at Community Living Toronto and the Toronto District School Board.
  </p>
  <p>
    Corey stands up for tenants and against corporate landlords. For vacancy
    rent control, no to Above the Guideline Rent Increases. He is a transit
    worker who will get Scarborough moving!

    Progressive politics is frozen far too long. Vote Socialist on November 30,
    or at the advance polls.
