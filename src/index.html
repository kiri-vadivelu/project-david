  <h1>Corey David for Scarborough Southwest, Ward 20</h1>

  <p>
    Municipal Socialist Alliance candidate, Corey David, is running for City
    Council in the Scarborough Southwest, Ward 20 by-election. Corey was the
    Socialist Action candidate in the January 2021 Scarborough Agincourt
    by-election. He championed social housing, quality public long-term care and
    health care, workers’ power, and police abolition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Corey is a member of the Amalgamated Transit Workers' Union. Previously, he
    worked as a machinist for 7 years, and before that he supported individuals
    with developmental disabilities, working as front-line staff at Community
    Living Toronto and the Toronto District School Board.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2020 Corey David campaigned to stop the for-profit housing development at
    the Quarry Lands, which destroyed the natural habitat and park space —
    another reason radical change is needed at City Hall. Vote Socialist on
    November 30, or at the advance polls.
